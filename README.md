# Voltage Metamorphosis

Welcome to the Voltage Metamorphosis repository! This project is a 3D top-down computer simulator sandbox desktop game developed in Unity Engine. The primary objective of the project is to provide a fun and educational experience for players to learn about basic concepts of computer architecure with the help of electricity and circuit wiring, and gradually design logical gates and more complex modules related to computer architecture.

## Features

- **Educational Gameplay**: Learn about electricity and circuitry in a fun and interactive way.
- **Incremental Design**: Design logical gates and save them for later use in creating integrated circuits and computer architecture modules.
- **Variety of Components**: Access minimal components to build circuits, including primitive gates, half/full adders, latches, registers, RAMs, ALUs, counters, and more.
- **Minimal Valuable Product (MVP)**: Focuses on delivering a basic version of the wiring simulator with essential features to aid students and enthusiasts in learning computer architecture.
- **Collaboration Opportunities**: Engage new developers in collaboration to further enhance the project.d

## Objectives

### Primary Objective
- Design and implement a 3D top-down computer simulator sandbox desktop game.
- Introduce players to basic concepts of electricity and circuit wiring.
